# Air-Sensor
/*
This Project relates to the one described here: 
The AirSensorTotal.ino file should successfully collect readings from the sensors and display the data on the serial monitor. From here, I am looking to add code that allows the Arduino and ESP to communicate. More precisely, the arduino should take the readings then send them to the ESP, which will then send the data to ThingSpeak.com. An example of how to send the data to ThingSpeak can be seen in the ThingSpeakCode.ino file. You will have to change the information for the wifi that you are connecting to (Advice: when I was on campus the easiest choice was to use a hot spot from my iPhone, rather than trying to convince UMass IT to let me use Eduroam or UMass Devices). Also, you should create your own ThingSpeak account and channel to receive the data on- Thus you will have to change the API key in the code too.
